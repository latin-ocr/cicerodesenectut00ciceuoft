this expression points to a proverb. The same whim has prevailed
in modern times. —quemquam, emphatic z I never heard of any
man who in ln‘s old age, etc. —vadimonia constituta, recogniz-
ances given, hence acting as bail, a very common occurrence with

ξ 22. quid, sc, faciunt—June consulti: these were persons
who made jurisprudence a study, and whose formally expressed
opinions (responsa) had much the same weight that judicial deci-
sions have at the present day (see Maine⁷s Ancierit Law, Ch. ΙΙ.

p. 42) .

They (JURISCONSULTI) were consulted by private persons to ascertain and secure their
rights, by advocates, jurors (judices), and even by the praet07s‚ who, though their duties
were judicial, were themselves rarely lawyerS, but politieians in the regular career of office.

· Until the Empire, their decisions had-no binding force, but only a moral influence. Au-

gustus gave to some jurists the ,fus respondendi, the right to interpret the law with binding .
force. See Hadley, Int. to Roman Law‚ pp. 61 aud 65.

By the side of the jurists who had authority in questions of civil law, are mentioned the
pontefices and augurs, who had the superintendence of what we may call ecclesiastical law
· (for the jus augurium, see Note on ᾗ 12). The jus panificium, exercised by the college
of pontfflces, had authority in the entire field of religious institutions⁷ except so far as
foreign rites were under the superintenclence of the quindecimviri sacris faciundis, who
had charge of the Sibylline books. The Pontifex Maximus was therefore the head of the
ecclesiastieal institutions ob Rome3 this office was conferred upon Augustus, as a regular
part of the Emperor‘s functions, who by this act became head of Church as well as of
State. This combination of supreme civil and ecclesiastical powers continued until the
Christian emperors.
