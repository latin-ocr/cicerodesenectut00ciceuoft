personal tribute of affection and admiration by one of his own house-
hold. No Classical work is therefore better fitted to form part of a
course which aims to contain only what is intrinsically best and
most characteristic. It is one of those tonia writings which help to
elevate and strengthen the moral nature and build up character.
The aim, in the present edition, has been to meet the needs of
such a course. The editor has left special philological training to
the teacher, only making occasional reference to the leading gram-
mars. On the other hand, he has undertaken to explain the his-
torical references with great fullness, and to give needful assistance
in all real difficulties. In the text he has for the most part followed
Kritz, but has not hesitated to vary from it when there seemed to
be good reason, especially in several cases to restore the reading of

the manuscripts.

It is the editor's intention to follow this, as early as possible·
(probably by the opening of the school year in 1881), with an

type.

M. Kellogg‚ Prof of Latin, Univ.
of Cal. .· Ι am sure the “Agricola '’ is
worthy of adoption as a text-book. Its
notes are scholarly, and not too volum-
incus, 1 am glad to see afavorite Latin
piece made so attractive. 1 have just
introduced your “Roman Literature''
as a text-book.

Frank Smalley, Profi of Latin,
Syracuse Univ.. N. Y. .· It seems to me
well prepared and judiciously annota-
ted, while the mechanical part, as in
all your books„ is all that could be de-
sired.

R. H. ‘Iu-ipp, Profi of Latin, Univ.
och‘nnesota .· After examining it, Ι do
not hesitate to pronounce it a ‘'peer''
of the many other excellent works pub-
lished by you. I think Professor Allen
has exercised excellent judgment as to
the text, and also as regard the notes,
—they are neither too copious nor too
meagre. It must readily find a place in
our colleges and universities.

· edition of the Germania of Tacitus, the text of which is already in,

Prot. J. C. Pickard‚ Ill. ludusa*
trial Univ„ Clzampazgrn‚ lll.: Ihave
read it, every word, with great pleasure.
The notes are admirable, just what are
most needed by those who study the
text. Iwish every young man in our
land would read thoughtfully the “Agri-
cola οἰ Tacitus,'' in Latin or Eng-
lish.

W. V. Sprouu, Profi os Latin,
Univ. of Cincinnati, Ο. .· This edition
of Agricola is deserving of great praise.

G. W. Shurtlefss Profi of Latin,v
Oberlin Coll.. O.: Ι like it very much*
as far as I have examined it.

W. S. Scarborough‚ Profi of
Latin, Wilberforce Univ„ Ο. .· In every
particular the “Agricola'' is up to the
standard, finished and complete. Shall
recommend its use here in our univer·
sity as the best work of the kind pub-

lished.
