RECENT PUBLICA TIONS.

Τ. Β. Mackey, Profi of Latin,
Wesleyan Sem„ Gouverneur, N.Y..· 1
compared it with two other prominent
works on the same subject, and think
for an introduction to Latin Prose it is
easily first. The use of connected nar-
rative as exercises, where other works
employ detached sentences, is a step in
advance. 1 shall certainly use itin my
next class. (Sept. 28, 1880.)

Rev. O. F. W. Hubbard, Chair-
man School Com„ Merrimac, Mass. .·
1 am pleased to commend it as the best
book of its kind for school use that has
ever come under my notice. I would
mention particularly, as worthy of com·
mendation, the helpful way in which it
anticipates and meets the peculiar diffi-
culties and questions that always trouble
beginners in the study; , its admirable
classification and distribution of sub-
jects treated: its oral exercises; its
excellent summaries of principles, and
lessons on special topics‚ such as the
’ English Potential and Comparative
Forms of Speech: and the perspicuous
and elegant style in which the book is
printed. Both in plan and execution
the intelligence and skill of the practi—
cal educator who knows just what
learners need, are amply evident.

The Now England Journal of

Education: The eminent fitness of

Mr. Allen, who has been all his life a
practica} teacher as -well as author, for
the preparation os such a work, will be

conceded by all American teachers and ·

scholars. He has made a useful and
practical book, which classical teachers
should examine.

The western, St. Louis .· The ex—

ercises, besides being well selected to ’

illustrate the various topics under which
they are grouped, have the merit in gen—
eral of pith and point—a merit which
will be appreciated by those who have
struggled to kindle enthusiasm in the
class-room over “the green specta-
cles of my grandfather’s cousin‚·· and
such like cruel shreds and tatters of
language. The order oftopics is logical,
beginning with simple elements, and
passing to special constructions and the
use of clauses.

Christian aeg-ister: The excel-
lence of Prof. Allen’s text-books is now
a proverb.

Otanada-school Journal: This
book is another proof of the steady
progress which our cousins on the
south side of the Great Lakes are mak-
ing. Not only is it a creditable speci-
men of the printer's art, but it is also
scholarly and practical. By means of
the system of references employed, it
may be used with either Allen and
Greenough's, Gildersleeve's, or Hark-
ness's Latin Grammar. The exercises
are well graded‚ and neither too easy
nor too difficult. We advise teachers
to examine it carefully before adopting
any other text-book on the subject.

The Life of Agricola stands by itself in ancient literature as a
biography of the modern type‚—not merely the worthily-related ·
life of an eminent man, like those of Plutarch and Nep05‚ but a
