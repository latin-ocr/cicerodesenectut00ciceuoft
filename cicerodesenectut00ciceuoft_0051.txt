sation: government was the business of a rich hereditary aris-
tocracy.) — plane grandis, quite advanced in years. —patientia,
stubborn endurance. — familiaris, rather an unwarranted term under
the circumstances. Towards the end of his life Cato modified his
stern conservatism so far as to make a study of Greek (see ξ 3);
but at the time alluded to he was the last man in Rome to make
an “intimate '' of a mere man of letters, of Greek birth too, like·
Ennius. Indeed, he reproached M. Fulvius Nobilior, the leader in
*the Hellenizing movement of the day, for having taken Ennius with
him on his campaign in Aitolia—cunctando, hence the name
Cunctator. —noenum, earlier form os non = ne unum (oenum), as
the English none—ponebat, ξ 375. g⁵.—post, i. e. not only
then, but as it is now. - magia, more (than it otherwise would).

of Cicero’s. Μ. Livius·Salinator was a distinguished and successful
general in the campaign against Hasdrubal, 13.C. 2073 it was M.
Livius Macatus that lost Tarentum, and gave efficient service· from
the citadel in its recovery. — certe, no doubt. —- vere, in truth'. —

(13.6. 228), being consul for a second term. — C. Flaminio, thechief'
popular leader of his day, often held up to reproach by writers, like
Cicero, of aristocratic sympathieS. The reproach was enhanced by
his disgraceful blunder in the battle of L. Trasimenus, B.C. 217, in
which his army was cut to pieces, and he himself killed.

In spite of his ill repute as a demagogue, and his military failure, Flaminius was the
author of some very salutary measures. “ In his tribunate, ac. 232, he carried the law here
referred to, dividing the Gallie and Picene territory among poor citizens, —the poliey after--
wards revived by the Gracchi, and perhaps the most hopeful remedy of the evils of the*
State. This measure he carried by a popular vote against the opposition of the Senate‚ an
act which was strictly unconstitutional‚ inasmuch as this was an administrative measure,¹
which fell within the province of the Senate. In his censorship, 13.c. 220, he laid out tlie
Flaminian Way, to the Picene and Gallie region, and built the Flaminian Circus. Shortly·
after, in the Senate‚ he was a chief supporter of the Claudian Law. by which Senators were
prohibited from engaging in trade. As this was a measure of directly the same tendency' as
the Cincian Law (see ᾗ 10), to maintain the authority of a non-commercia] aristocracy, it
certainly seems free from demagogism. 1nasmuch, however, as it thwarted the pecuni-
ary interests os the Senators, it made them bitterly hostile to him.

dicere ausus est. -The expression here quoted was safe enough
in the mouth of a leader of the aristocracy— as Fabius was ——at once
Senator, executive officer, and interpreter of the omens. But it of
course struck at the root of the whole Roman polity and religion,
· betraying a decline of saith, which was the first symptom of national
decay. —0ptimis auspiciis, etc„ compare Iliad, xii. 243.

ξ 12. quo modo tulit: the indic. (instead of the subj. of indir.
question) is perhaps chosen as belonging to the old style (ξ 334,
d); otherwise the antecedent modus must be understood, which
