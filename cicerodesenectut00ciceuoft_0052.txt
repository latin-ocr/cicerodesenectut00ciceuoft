seems harsh. -- filii consularis z this son, who had the same name
as his father, was consul B.C. 213. It is of him that the story is
told, strongly characteristic of Roman customs, that his father, being
sent as legatus to his camp, and meeting him as he proceeded with
his train of lictors, neglected to alight from his horse, as respect for
*the consul required. Upon this a lictor, at the son’s order, com-
manded him to dismount3 when he sprang at once to his feet, with
,the words, “ Ι wished to see, my son, how well you knew that you
*were consul '’ (Liv. xxiv. 44). —est . . . laudatio, his eulogy
is textam—quem philosophum, etc., i. e. a nobler temper than

law of the Romans.

It was characteristic of both Greeks and Romans, and one of the chief sources of their
enduring sreedom, that they had no priestly class, but that the religion of the State and the
political administration of the State were in the same hands. A few priestly offices of low
grade were held as professions by men of low rank; a few priesthoods of great dignity but
of no politica] influence‚ such as that of rex sacrzficulus, flamen, the Salii, etc., were held
for life by men of rank, selected solely for their patrician birth: but the great colleges ospon-
t4'fices, augurs, etc., which >had control of the religious institutions in their relation to the
government, were invariably made up of leading statesmen. For example, Cicero was
augur, Caesar was pontifex. From this it resulted that the interests os a priesthood were
never, as in Egypt aud other eastern countries‚ suffered to intersere with the interests of the
State. The jus augurium was the code of rules by which the college ot augurs interpreteri-
the auspices, or expressed will of the gods.

multae, etc., a good knowledge of literature for a Roman; they
were, of course, behind the Greeks.
