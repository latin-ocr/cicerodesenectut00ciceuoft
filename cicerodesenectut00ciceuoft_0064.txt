ξ 54. dixi (emphatic), l have already told. —de rebus rusticis :

The desiderium is for the long absence of his son at the siegessof

mind might include the other.

Cinoinnato: Cincinnatus was dictator twice. The famous inci-
dent of his being called from the plough belongs to his first dicta-
torship, 13.c. 458 ; the second (ss.c. 439), seditiones sedandoe causa,
was occasioned¹ by the uneasiness of the patricians at the popularity
and ambition of Spurius Maelius. The only offence of Maelius, so
far as was proved, was that he lavished his wealth to relieve the
poor in a time of famine. This brought him into suspicion of schem-
ing to make himself king, and rumor had it that he had filled his house
with arms, and held nightly meetings of conspirators.—-aranti‚
