deprivation of political rights, any person whom they chose.
(See ξ 42.) A cause must be assigned; but e'ven if this were
omitted, there seems to have been no appeal from their Δ

- judgment. Flaccus, the colleague of Cato, stood steadily

by him in his action as censor, and, with his narrowneSS‚
obsffinacy, prejudice, but entire honesty‚ he exercised the ·
power of his office with relentless vigor. If it was especially
⁷his own private enemies that he punished, no doubt he
sincerely believed them to be dangerous to the State, or they
would not be enemies of his. s
These characteristics clung to him through life. What-
ever was new he opposed3 and in this way he has the
creditos having resisted many baneful innovations, as also
many salutary ones. He had no capacity to distinguish

’ between the steady movement of national life and those

insidious influences from outside, which eat out the national
vigor. By his stubborn conservatism he gained therepute
of being a typical Roman of the old school; while, in fact,
the glory and strength of Rome lay in her ability to draw-
into herself, and not exclude or destroy‚ the life of the races‘
she subdued.

The writings of Cato were: 1. De Re Rustica, the first
Latin treatise on agriculture, full of practical observations
and directions, in great part still extant; 2. Oregrines, the
first historical work in Latin, curtly and briefly told, from
the earliest legendary stories down to his own day, of which
only fragments 1·emain; 3. various writings on polines,
antiquities, and war, with numerous orations, of which
Cicero had read ‘⁶ more than a hundred and fifty.” '¹‘
