ἐ 43. Cinea: Cineas was a pupil of Demosthenes, whom Pyrrhus
sent as ambassador to Rome after his first victory, over Laevinus
(B.C. 280). Two years later was the Roman embassy of Fabricius
and others to Pyrrhus, to whom Cineas returned the hospitality

which he had experienced in Rome—quendam, i. e. Epicurus, .

whom Cicero never loses an opportunity to attack‚ and to whom the
Stoics were especially opposed (see “Orations‚” note to Sest.
ἓ 9). -ut id persuaderetur (ἓ 225. c, 230), that they mzjglzt be
persuaded of this. —Samnitibus; the Samnites were a vigorous
and powerful nation of Central Italy, the last and most per- .
sistent defenders of Italian independence against Rome. The
third Samnite War ended, with their overthrow, B.C. 29o.—de-

dissent, for fut. perf. of dir. disc.—vixerat (emphatic): he had .

lived with him, and so knew him better than to suppose him in-
fluenced by pleasure.—Decio: P. Decius Mus, consul for the
fourth time, B.C. 295. In his consulship was fought, at Sentinum,
the decisive battle against the great coalition of Italian nations,
headed by the Samnites (third Samnite War). When Decius saw
that the battle was going hard with his men, he devoted himself to
the gods by a solemn act of consecration (see Livy, viii. 9), rushed
into the thickest of the enemy, and perished. His death was
followed by a complete victory, which broke up the alliance,
although the war dragged on five years longer. The story went that
the father of Decius had devoted himself in like manner in the Latin
War‚ forty-two years before, 13.C. 337. — Curius, the oldest of the
three statesmen here mentioned (cos. B.C. 290), had had personal in-
tercourse (vixerat) with Decius ; while Fabricius and Coruncanius
were only acquaintances (norat).—profect0, without question.—
aliquid natura, etc„ the fundamental moral doctrine of the Stoics.

test, see § 317. c. —Duellium‚ cos. nc. 260, in which year he
gained· a naval victory over the Carthaginians. Knowing the
superiority of the enemy in naval tactics, he undertook to balance
this by a kind of boarding-bridge, which grappled the enemies' ships
and held them fast, after which the battle became essentially a land
fight, decided by the prowess of the soldiers rather than by naval
manoeuvres. This victory over the enemy on their own ground, in
a branch of warfare in which the Romans were wholly inex-
perienced‚ naturally was of incalculable value in raising their spirits
and confidence, and gained great reputation for their commander.
A column, adorned with the beaks of ships, was erected on the
Forum in his honor, of which fragments are still extant. -sump-
serat: this honor appears to have been granted by authority, not
assumed by himself, as the text would imply.
