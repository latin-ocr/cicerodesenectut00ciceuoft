ing the long vowels in the Latin words
employed.” This is a matter of more
importance than even Prof. Allen him-
self is perhaps aware. There is no
doubt that if the pronunciation of Latin
prose is properly taught—a point to
which the marking of every long vowel
is indispensable—the proper method
of reading Latin poetry comes almost
of itself‚ and the greater part of the
stuff with which learners are tormented,
under the name of Prosody, may be
dismissed at once as mere rubbish.

william G. Halo, Prof. of Latin
in Cornell Uniu: I am sorry that 1
am not able to-day, as I shall be some
months hence, to tell you of the actual
working of Allen's Introduction in the
class-room. But an examination of
the book has given me such confidence
in it that it already stands recom-
mended in our requirements for ad-
mission, and the later chapters will be
used by our Foeshmen. The wise help
in the way of suggestion and vocabu-
lary given the pupil at the start, the
careful development of construction,
the apt notes and cautious scattered
throughout the exercises, the placing
under nearly every lesson, not merely
of disjointed sentences illustrative of
the point in hand, but ot' short sen-
tences for oral translation, and of a
passage of connected, straight-away
English, are features which, admirable
as they are, in this book lie upon the
surface.

The book is by no means a mere
collection of classified English sen-
tences with references to leading gram-
marS. Though giving such references
under each topic, it states for itself
nearly every principle taken up, and
that in a singularly clear and effective
way. Add to this a correct spelling,
and—what must gratify the eye of

ular of such as hold that a culpable
waste of time is caused to pupils through
the careless pronunciation by teachers
of words which both pupil and teacher
are obliged to pronounce quite differ-
ently when they come to read verse—-
the careful marking of all known vowel-
lengths, even to such cases as pablz'cus,
nic‘ntc'o, sciscitor, dignus, infensus, etc.
The book, like very few school-books,
is of a character to gratify the practical

teacher, and to satisfy the critical stu-
dent. (Feb. 15, 1881.)

W. A. Packard, Profl os Latin,
Princeton Coll., N..J .· Itis excellently
adapted to its purpose, and the use of
it by pupils preparing to enter this col-
lege we should heartily approve.

Edward Η. Griffln, Profi of
Latin, W'z'lliams Call„ Mass. .· My rea-
son for continuing to put Arnold's into
our requirements for admission, is
merely because it is so old and well
known that every one will understand
the amount of instruction that is ex-
pected. Allen's is certainly a much
better book, and leaves little to be de-
sired. College instruction would be
much more satisfactory in its results if
students were taught syntax in their
preparatory studies through the use of
such a book, instead of by ‘⁴ grammar
lessons.” (Jan. 4, 1881.)

E. P. CroweH, Profi osLatin, and
W. L. Cowles, lnstructor in Latin,
Amherst Coll..· 1t seems to us. after a
somewhat careful examination, to be a
most excellent book of its kind. Its
subject-matter is so well selected, and
so carefully arranged, that it must be a
profitable manual for practical use in
the hands of every Latin student.
