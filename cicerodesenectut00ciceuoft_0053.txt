pio, coss. B.c.169. -legem Voconiam : this was one of the princi-
pal sumptuary laws of the Romam, or laws designed to control
the private life and luxury of individuals.

‘⁴ The Voconian law, passed during the later republic, 169 Β. c., imposed a restrictiori on

the institution of women as heirs. It applied only to large estates A person whom the
census placed m the first class, as having a rated property of at least one hundred thou-

sand asses (i. e. one thousand dollars, which m purchasing power was worth as much as ten
thousand now), such a person was forbidden to appoint a woman as heir . . . The alleged
design of the statute is said to have been to restrain the growing luxury and extravagance oi
women, by withholding from them the means of being luxurious and extravagant on a large
scale. It can hardly be supposed, however, that this was the principal reason sor the meas-
ure. A stronger reason must have been the desire of the wealtliy class to keep large estates
in the families, the agnate families, to which they belonged ς if such an estate became the
inheritance of a woman, it was apt to pass by her marriage into another family.⁷' Hadlep

’7. ἓ 16. Claudi: App. Claudius, known as Caecus (the blind)
or the Censor, one of the few men of real genius among the
statesmen of the old Republic. In his censorship (Rc. 311) he
attempted some democratic innovations (which were set aside
by his successor, Q. Fabius Maximus, ancestor of the Cunctator)
and built the first military road, the Appza Vza,· he also was the
first to bring a supply of fresh water into the city by the Aqua
Appzssa The incident here related of him, that when blind and
old he had himself brought into the Senate in order to oppose
negotiations with Pyrrhus, and to insist that there should be no
negotiations with a foreign enemy on the soil of Italy, is the
most illustrious 1n his life. The speech in which he enforced this
policy was extant in the time of Cicero, and passed as the earliest
specimen of Roman prose literature. *accedebam i. e. to the
