was written at the age of sixty-two years and upwards, and
was addressed to his friend Atticus, who was three years
' older.* It belongs to the division of Ethics, which had for
its subject—matter the nature of the summum bonum, and the
· conduct of life. Since the third century B.c. philosophy
had lost the hope of substituting reason for violence in the
management of affairs, and had aimed to find for the individ—
ual philosopher, in virtue or pleasure or elsewhere, a satis-
faction to outweigh the inevitable ills of life. Every relation
and incident of life was a subject of philosophical discus-
γ sion, either from the pleasure it could afford, or the pain it
was vulgarly supposed to cause.

In this treatise Cicero, imitating Aristo of Ceos, endeav-
ors to show that old age, usually considered one of the ills
of life, is to the wise man deprived of its terrors. In form
it imitates the Socratic or Platonic dialogue, the slight part
taken in it by the other speakers serving only to give an air
of reality, and to mark the divisions of the subject, while the
name of Cato gives dignity and weight to the argu1nent.†
The dialogue is put, apparently, in the last year of Cato's
long life, and represents the old man discoursing, calmly
and cheerfully, with the younger Scipio (AEmilianus),

⁴ brotherzin-law of Cato's-elder son, and his friend Laelius,

the same who gives his name to the dialogue on Friendship.·
Cicero himself was strongly attracted by some points of the
old statesman's life and character, his plebeian birth, his
political struggles, his intellectual eminence, and his genuine
love of rural occupations. The incidents of his career he
hasstudied carefully, and introduced into his discourse, with
here and there a bit of his antique style, — antiquior sermo,

* Ad senem senex de senectute—Lan. i. 5. Legendus mihi
saepius est Cato Major ad te missus. Amariorem enim,me senectus
facit: stomachor omnia. -- Att. xiv. 21.

† Catonem induxi senem disputantem, quia nulla videbatur aptior
persona quae de illa aetate loqueretur, quam ejus qui et diutissime
senex fuisset, et in ipsa senectute praeter ceteros floruisset. . . .
Itaque ipse mea legens sic afficior interdum, ut Catonem, non me,

loqui existimem. —Lae1. i. 4·
