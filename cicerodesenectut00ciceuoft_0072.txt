cial feature of this introductory portion is the large space given to
Oral Exercises‚ interlz‘ned, and thus designed to familiarize the

pupil with words and forms without the weary and disheartening
incessant dependance on grammar and lexicon.

The whole of the revision—including the preparation of Part
First— has been made by Rev, J. H. Allen‚ Lecturer in Harvard
University‚ and compiler of the “New Latin Method‚'' assisted'
throughout by‘ the ample and critical supervision of Mr. John
Tetlow, Principal of the Girls' Latin School, Boston. The work has
also been critically revised by Prof. Tracy Peck, of Yale College‚
Great care has been bestowed upon the markingofall long τυπείς·
(whether or not long by position), making the book, it is hoped, a
serviceable guide in the elementary principles of Latin Etymology

as well as Prosody.

'I'he Natiom N. Y.: A second
edition of a small Latin text-book is
usually entitled to no special notice,
but the new edition of Prof. Allen's
⁰¹ Introduction to Latin Prose Compo-
sition '' is in some respects exceptional.
The first edition was published about
ten years ago. The present edition has
been enlarged so as to include the more
elementary constructions of Latin Syn-
tax‚ and the whole work revised. It is
seldom that so much learning, experi-
en ce, and intellectual ability are brought
to bear in the construction of an ele-
mentary text-book.

The number of persons to whom it
is worth while to spend the time and

- labor necessary to learn to write Latin

easily and fluently is very small, and is
probably decreasing the world over.
Latin composition is generally studied
less for its own sake than as one of the
best means os learning to read and ap-
preciate the Latin authors. For this
purpose the present work seems all-
sufficient. For those who intend to
make the Latin language a special
object of study after leaving college it
is, of course, what its title declares, only
nn introduction.

The following points seem worthy
of attention. The English examples
which are to be translated into Latin
are themselves translations from pas-
sages actually occurring in the Latin
authors. Experience unmistakably tes·
tifies to the advantages of this plan in'
an elementary work. The constant.
even minute, references ,to the grammar
accustom students to solve difficulties
by the application os general princi-
ples. The references are to the gram-
mar of Messrs. Allen and Greenough,
but accompanying every one there is,
in a parenthesis, a reference to the
grammars of Prof. Gildersleeve and of
Prof. Harkness; the work is thus ren—
dered equally convenient to those who
have any one of the three grammarS.
Those who have access to them all
will find it worth the trouble to* 'com-
pare the different ways in which the
same matters are viewed and stated
by these accomplished Latin scholars.
The best thing those students whohave
none of these grammarswan dosirre-
spective of the use of the present work,
is to get one as soon as possible.
Lastly, but not least, Prof. Allen says'
