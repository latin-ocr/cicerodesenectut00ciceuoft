RE CEN T PUBLI CA TI ONS.

1 pronounce it, without hesitation,
greatly superior to any publication of
the kind in the arrangement, fulness,
accuracy, and convenience of its con-
tents. (Oct. 29, 1880.)

J. Ο. Nouaesium, Prosl of Latin,
Wooster Univ„ 0..· Ι like it very well,
and have recommended it to my class
instead of Kiepert, which has hitherto
been in use here. I think it the best
Classical Atlas now within reach of our
college students. (Oct. 22, 1880.)

0. W. Super, Profi of Greek, Olzio
Unzv„ Athens, O. .· Ι am much pleased
with the Classical Atlas. Its plan is
excellent, and its execution carried out
with unusual care. One rarely sees an
ancient Atlas in which all the maps,
both large and small, are so carefully
printed and colored. The map of the
Barbarian Inroads is a valuable feature,
and Ι have rarely seen what Iregarded
as so satisfactory a representation of
the Geog. of Homer. 1 shall be glad
to do all I can to extend the use of this
Atlas, believing that it will be a valuable
aid to the cause of classical learning.

. Chae. Chandler‚ Profl of Latin,
Denison Univ„ Granvz'lle, Okio .· -I am
satisfied that on the whole yours is the
best Atlas for students’ use, and that it
is hereafter to be the Classical Atlas.
(Dec. 27, 1880.)

D. C. Brown, Jnstructor in Greek,
Butler Univ., lrvington, Ind. .· Your
Atlas is the best I have seen, and Ι
shall use it in the Greek department.
(Nov. 23, 1880.)

John R. Sampson, Profi of Latin,
Davidson Call„ N.C. .· Ι am much
pleased with the work, and shall intro-
duce it at once in our Freshman class.

(Jan. 25, 1881.)

A. G. Peridus, Prin. Phillips Exe-

ter Acad„ N.H. .· Ginn & Heath's Clas· ,

sical Atlas seems to me to be just what is
needed in reading the Latin and Greek
Classics of school and college. It con—
forms to the most recent and best au-
thorities, and presents a page with type
unusually clear and agreeable to the
eye. Ι believe that all students of Vir·
gil, Livy, Xenophon, Homer, and He-
rodotus, however well provided with the
other standard maps in common use,
will find it convenient to have this be-
sides. (Dec. 20, 1880.)

Robt. F. Pennell, Classical Mas-
ter, Plzillz'ps Exeter Acad., N.H. : Your
Classical Atlas pleases me much. It is
well adapted for general use in our high
schools and academies, and will un-
doubtedly meet with the success it
deserves. (Dec. 20, 1880.)

C. F. P. Bancroft, Prin. Phillips
Acad., Andover, Mass. : 1 have used
the Atlas for two years, like it, and
recommend it. (Dec. 2, 1880.)

D. Y. comstock, Classical Dept„
Phillips Acad.. Andover, Mass. .· 1 am
very much pleased with it, and shall
recommend it to my classes. You have
done an excellent service to our schools
and school-boys in bringing the work
within so easy range of the average
purse. The index, also, presents a num-
ber of features peculiar to this collec-
tion of maps. (Dec. 15, 1880.)

Ε. G. Coy, Instructor in Greek,
Phillips Acad., Andover, Mass. .· 1 have
already had occasion to recommend
the foreign edition, and arn glad that
we can now enjoy the book at your
hands. It seems to me more desirable
for the student than any with which Ι
am acquainted.
