have put it in the mouth of a fit speaker; not Tithonus, but, etc.”—
Tithono, the husband of Eos (Aurora). The gods gave the gift of
immortality to him at her request, but she forgot to ask for perpetual
youth, so he became a stock example of age. Life soon became a
burden to him; as a second boon, he was changed into a ,cicada

Laelium et Scipionem, these two names are types, of friendship,

Ρ. Cornelius Scipio AEmilianus (cos. 13.c. 1473 known also as Africanus Μὶηον, to d's-
tinguish him from his grandiather by adoption, the conqueror of Hannibal) was son of L.
AEmilius Paulus, the conqueror of Macedonia, but passed by adoption into the family of
Scipio. As a statesman and general he was first of his age; of unblernished private
character, and of a calm good sense which was the quality most needed in his time·
Mommsen says of him: “The history of Rome preseuts various men of greater genius
than Scipio AEmihanus, but none equalling him in moral purity, in the utter absence of
politica] selfishness, in generous love of his country, and none, perhaps, to whom destiny
has assigned a more tragic part.'’ He was assassinated, Β c 129, probably by the infamous
Carbo. C. Laelius is known to us principally by his association with Scipio: he was in his
time a man of high culture and considerable influence, especially noted as a public speaker.
