W. W. Goodwin‚ Profi of Greek,
Harvard Univ. .· Your Classical Atlas
is a most beautiful and highly useful
work, and I am glad to see what used
to be an expensive luxury brought
within the means of all students of the

classics. (Dec. 2, 1880.)

Irving J . Manatt, Pros. of Greek,
Mzrc'etta Coll„ 0: Ι regard this work
as a most timely one. A complete
Atlas of the ancient world, compaet
and cheap, remained a desideratum. I
think this one fills the bill. Its twenty-
four maps are accurately drawn and
admirably printed. The index enables
the student to determine at a glance
the pronunciation of any name, its
modern form or successor, and its
place on the map——saving how much
precious time! (Nov. 12, 1880.)

S. R. Winans, Tutor in Greek,
Frzssvcelon Coll„ NJ: It is superb:
nothing to criticise, and everything to
commend. It is needless to go into
details about it. I shall acquaint the

Academia Williston Seminary,

attractiveness. Every student of the
classics needs something of the sort,
and this is by all odds the best os its
kind. (Oct. 4, 1880.) ’

C. R. Williams, T utor in Latin,
Princeton Coll„ N.J. .· Ι have examined
the Atlas with considerable care, and
shall take great pleasure in recommend-
ing it to my classes. I am very much
pleased with it mysels. The colored
maps, the elearness of the names, the
distinct marking of important routes
and movements of peoples, with other
special features, render it at the same
time more attractive 'and more useful

to the student than Long's.
(Oct. 4, 1880.)

W. B. Owen, Tutor in Lafayette
Call„ East0n‚Pa. .· I like the Atlas very
much indeed, and if it were not so late
in the term should feel disposed to
strongly recommend it to our class.
Next year 1 think we shall give it the
preference. (Oct. 11, 1880.)
