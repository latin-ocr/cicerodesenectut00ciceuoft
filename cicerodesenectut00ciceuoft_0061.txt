a guild, sodalitas, consisting of a number of guild-brethren, sodales.
Whenever a new worship was introduced, a new guild was organ-
ized to take charge of it. The innovation in Cato's quaestorship,
s here spoken of, could not have been the establishment of the
sodalitas, for this was an institution of great antiquity3· it was
probably the custom of public banquets of the brethren that came
up at this time. By the expression habui semper sodales Cato
probably means that he has kept up his membership and his attend-
ance at the banquets.—Magnae Matris, i. e. Rea or Cybele, a
goddess of nature, worshipped with wild rites on Mt. Ida, and in
other parts of Asia Minor.

The Romans found in the Sibylline Books, during the war with Hannibal, a prophecy
that asoreign enemy would be expelled from Italy when the Idaean mother should come
from Pessinus to Rome. An embassy was accordingly sent to King Attalus of Pergamus,
who actually gave into their possession the meteoric stone which was the fetish of this wor-
ship. The oracle prescribed that it should be received by the man qui vir optimus Romae
esset, and the Senate fixed upon the young Publius-Scipio Nasica, son of Cneius (see
§ 29). From this time the worship of the Great Mother was one of the most popular of
the religions of Rome: it was celebrated in the Megalesza, April 4-10, with processions,
beating of drums, and dramatie exhibitions.
