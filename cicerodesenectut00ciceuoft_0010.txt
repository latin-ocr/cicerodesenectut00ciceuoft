viii Introduction.

horridiora verbm* But though the discourse is put in
Cato’s mouth, it is Cicero that speaks. Not merely is there
the ripe Latin of the last century of the Republic, and the

⁴ perfectiori of style of the greatest of Roman authors, but

the thoughts and sentiments, even, are not such as belong
to the tough and hard-headed Cato, whom Cicero employs
as a lay-figure, to be dressed in the mental costume of his

own da .
And‚ywithal, he fashions the antique character into some-

thing of his own more modern likeness. The Cato of the
dialogue is mild-mannered, reflective, at home in philo*
sophical literature, and even not disinclined to music, after
the example of Socrates. The real Cato was ‚harsh in
temper narrow in prejudice, a shrew ’d hater of the elder
Scipio who was his iival, and ofthe whole par ty ofrefinement.
He v as a man ‘⁴ ofiron strength of body and mind, of antique
sternness and fi1mness of character of simplicity and thrift,
of patriotism that was close to narrow bigotry, of strength of
will and patient temper, of unwearied force of toil and thirst
for knowledge, with a copious knowledge of law and avigor-
ous original eloquence, of bravery and generalship, of ner-
vous activity in his province as husbandman and house· ,
holder, as statesman and writer, with a high reputation for
practica] sagacity, commandihg the unshaken regard of the
people and senate, in both public and private life, and all
this to the very end of his ¹great old age.'' †

So far as any connection with the substance of the book
is concerned, we might dismiss Cato with these few words.
It is necessary, however, briefly to describe his life and
character, by way of explaining the allusions in the body
of the work.

MARCUS PORcms CATo— ‘⁶ the Elder'’ or the “ Censor ”
—was born at Tusculum, of a plebeian family, B.c. 234. His

† Lahmeyein’ Cicero seems to have been aware of this inconsis-
tency in the delineation (see ξ 3). Perhaps he meant to recom-
mend philosophy by making even Cato in his last years attracted
by it.
