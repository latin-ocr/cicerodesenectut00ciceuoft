’κ ἐς 34-42·] De Sehectute. 47

of about the middle of the fourth century nc. (Plato died in 348).-—
voluptatem, ξ 336. b, R.—avidae, i. e. in their eagerness for. —
temere, haedlessly; ecfrenate, uncurbed. —incitarentur, are im-

s' pelled (for the tense, see ξ 287, d).

ἓ 4ο. hinc = a corporis voluptate. —- proditionem acts ο]
treason (a common Latin use of the plural); eversioneS, over-
throws. —nasci‚ spring. ——denique, z’n a word—scelus, a more
abstract term than facinus. In Cicero's time, facinus appears to
have been mostly used in a bad sense3 but not originally, and
hence it is here qualified with malum. —stupra vero, ancl as to de-
baucheries, etc. — excitari, stz'rrecl up. — muneri, sanction (if
given by nature) ; dono, gift (if bestowed by divine power).

ξ 41. nec enim, etc., for (of course) there z‘s no roem for sels-
control when lust is tyrant. —- fingere animo, imagine. —— Jubebat,
censebat: observe the partial return to the direct narrative-——per-

quocirca resumes as a conclusion the first statement, nullam esse,
etc., in the indirect form, whence the subjunctives esset, exstin-
gueret—haec, etc., thus my host Nearchus used to say (that) lte
had heard that Archytas dz‘scoursed witlz Pontius. Pontius was the
noble Samnite who gave the wise advice, that unless the Roman
army at the Caudine F orks should be massacred to a man, it should
be released without dishonorable conditions. The neglect of this
counsel, with the infamous duplicity of the Romans, eost the life of
that gallant state. —cum quidem, at tlte very time when (inter-
fuisset is the subj. of indir. disc„ not on account of cum).

16, 1... Camillo, etc. : this was 13.C. 349, the year before Plato’s

death. Plato's latest authentic visit to Sicily (his third) was 361 ;
it is probable therefore that Cicero was wrong here.

c). ——- intellegeretis, etc., imperf. as following the implied past
tense—invitus feci ut eicerem (ξ 332. e) = I reluctantly ex-

full number ofyears intervening between the consulship of L. Flamin-'
inus (13.c. 192) and the consulship of Cato and L. Flaccus (184) 3 the
censorship of T. Flamininus and M. Marcellus was B.C. 189. (The
story is an illustration of the preceding sentence, but the old man's
loquacity destroys the logical connection). —notandam; the tech-
nical word for the formal mark of disapprobation nota censoria, offi-
cially passed upon a man by the censors. —exoratus est, was pre-
vallea on, compare Liv. xxxix, 43 3 Plutarch Flamin. 18.
