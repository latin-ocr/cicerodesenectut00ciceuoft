Thomas Chase, pres„ and Prof
⁰s, Philology, Haverford Coll. .· Schoe-
mann's Introduction, Summaries, and
Commentary are learned and judi-
cious, and wherever any additional
aid was necessary, it has been skil-
fully supplied by the American editor.

O. Howes, Profi of Latin, Madi-
son Univ„ N. Y. .· The Introduction, the
Summaries, and the Notes of Schoe-
mann furnish a very complete exposi-
tion of the argument and philosophie
content of this work of Cicero. The
grammatical notes of Mr. Stickney are
excellent, and have so well supple-
mented Schoemann's work where it
most needed it, that the only regret left
is that they are not more numerous; a
result Ι, for one, should gladly have
purchased by the abridgement, if nec-
essary, of those of Schoemann.

Geo. B. Hopson, Prof of Latin,
St. Stephen's Coll.. Annandak, Ny. .·
It is a work which was very much
needed. 1 believe that Prof. Stickney
has done his work in a very scholarly
and satisfactory manner. 1 shall take
pleasure in recommending this edition.

Solon Albee, late Profi of Latin,
Middlebury Call„ Vt. : Ι am glad to
see this interesting classic brought out
in an edition which is in all respects so
admirable. The Introduction and Com—
mentary accompanying it are prepared
with scholarly care, and afford the
learner valuable aid in gaining a cor-
rect understanding of the text and the
subject-matter of which it treats, A
book which is at once so instructive
and attractive in style cannot fail to be
welcomed by all lovers of classical
learning.

Wilford Caulkins, Profi of Greek
and Latin in East Tennessee W'esleyan
Univ.‚Atlzens, Tenn. .· The annotations
are peculiarly valuable and judicious3
and it is my judgment that this most
excellent edition of a work in many
respects invaluable‚ ought at once to
be introduced into all our college
courseS. For my part, it is my inten-
tion to place it in the hands of the
senior class next year, and Ι will see

that it has a place in our next cata-
logue.
