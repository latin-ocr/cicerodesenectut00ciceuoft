N. E. Journal of Education:
Teachers and students of the classics
are placed under great obligations to
this enterprising firm for supplying
them with so many excellent classical
manuals. This one is edited by Pros.
Allen, whom we know to be eminently
fitted, by 'scholarship and experience in
teaching, to perform the task. We are
glad he has given his attention to the
biography of Agricola by Tacitus. It
is one ofthe grand models ofbiography.
The study of such a classic would tend
to elevate and strengthen the character
of any student. The letter-press and
binding are admirable.

School Bullatin‚ Nx: Of all
Latin classics this is among the most
charming, and we welcome this desir-
able edition, in which the author is
especially happy in giving just notes
enough.

chicago Advance: The Notes
are brief, pertinent, and judicious, as·
fording real help to the student, but
careful not to weaken his scholarly in-
dependence by giving excessive ¹⁸ help.''
The typography of the book is well-nigh
perfect.

Coll. .· The value of Schoemann's
edition has long been known, and 1
arn glad that so carefui a scholar
as Prof. Stickney has brought it to the
easy reach of American students. The
translator's additions, too, seem to be
thoroughly helpful to a nicer under-
standing of the thought and Latinity
of the original.

.Minton warren, Associate Prof
of Latm, Jolm Hopkc’ns Univ..· Ι am
greatly pleased with it. The work of
translation seems to have been very
cai-efully done, and bespeaks accurate

W. A. Packard‚ Profi of Latin,
Princeton Call. .· I have used the Ger-
man Edition with my classes, and ap-
preciate its well-recognized merits.
The additions made to the notes, which
I have examined, add to their value.
It will be a· convenience for American
students to have the book in its present

C. J. HarflS, Profi of Latin, Wash.

mendable example in giving Schoe-
