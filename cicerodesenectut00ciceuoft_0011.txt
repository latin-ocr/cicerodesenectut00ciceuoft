military tribune, in Sicily and Africa as quaestor under
Scipio (B.c. 204), as consul in Spain (B.c. 195), and as

in forcing on the third and last war with Carthage. He died
the following year, at the age of eighty-five.

Cato is best known by the severity with which he exer-

is best known, Censorius, or the censor. This office was
then at the height of its efficiency, and was an engine of
